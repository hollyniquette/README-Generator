## Description

A command-line interface application that helps users easily generate a professional README file for their projects. Based on the information provided by the user when prompted in the CLI, a README file will be automatically created and structured in markdown format.

## Installation and Usage

Use the `npm i` command to install dependences.

Run the application using the `node index.js` command in the terminal.

Provide the information you want to be displayed in each section when prompted:

- Title
- Description
- Installation instructions
- Usage information
- Guidelines for contribution
- License type
- GitHub username
- Email address

A README.md file in markdown format will be generated in the current directory after all prompts are completed. It will include a dynamic Table of Contents that jumps to a selected section, and clickable links to your GitHub and email.

## Guidelines for Contribution

No touchy!

## Testing Instructions

Test manually by running the application and verifying the generated `README.md` file has the correction information structured in markdown format.
